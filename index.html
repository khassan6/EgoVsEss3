        This tool helps you reflect on whether you're operating from <strong>ego</strong>—driven by protection, performance, and proving—or from your <strong>essence</strong>—your truest, most grounded self.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Through 20 questions, you'll uncover the patterns shaping your decisions, energy, and identity. The result will reveal your current mode of being and offer insights to realign with your deeper self.
